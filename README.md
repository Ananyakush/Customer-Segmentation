# Retailer store data - Customer Segmentation Project  (with K-mean & Hierarchical Clustering)

### Problem Statement

### Client Name: "Retail Solutions"

### Background:
Retail Solutions is a mid-sized retail company that operates in multiple urban centers. Despite steady sales, the marketing team is struggling to optimize their campaigns due to a lack of clear understanding of customer behavior. Currently, marketing strategies target customers with a one-size-fits-all approach, which leads to inefficient allocation of resources and reduced customer engagement.

### Business Problem:
The company wants to segment its customer base into distinct groups based on purchasing patterns, spending behavior, and demographics. The goal is to design tailored marketing strategies for each segment, improving customer satisfaction, retention, and overall revenue.

### Objective:
Analyze customer data (e.g., demographic details, annual income, spending score) to identify natural groupings within the customer base.
Create meaningful customer segments that provide actionable insights into behavior and preferences.
Provide clear recommendations for targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment.

# Note
## we'll answer all our deliverables after executing DBSCAN . For now we have iimplemented model with k-mean and Hierarchical Clustering algorithm.


### Deliverables:
1. A detailed report explaining the customer segments and the characteristics of each group.
2. Visualizations to clearly demonstrate the clustering results (e.g., scatter plots, dendrograms).
3. A comparison of clustering approaches (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN) to explain which method performs best and why.
4. Specific, actionable recommendations for marketing campaigns or product offerings based on the identified segments.

### Key Questions to Answer:
1. How many distinct customer segments exist in the dataset?
2. What are the defining characteristics of each segment (e.g., high-income, low-spending customers)?
3. How can these segments be used to improve targeted marketing strategies?

### Dataset:
The company has provided customer data, including the following features:

1. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. Gender: Male or Female.
3. Age: Customer's age in years.
4. Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars.
5. Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned to customers based on their spending habits.
